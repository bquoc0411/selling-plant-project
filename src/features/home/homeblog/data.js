      "Let's be honest. When my plants look sad, it's a heart-breaking moment. First, because I think it's my fault, and, second, because I don't know what to do. But this can change. As an indoor plant fanatic, people often tell me about their green companions' misfortunes. If your plant's leaves look droopy or brown, you're not alone. Many of us bought a plant because it's nice, but overlooked a few basic things when it comes to plant care. Here are the top mistaken ideas I hear and see all the time, debunked:",

      "Some plants can pull triple duty for the senses – they don't just look pretty and taste incredible, they smell great, too! While all kitchens would benefit from having a windowsill herb garden, there are a few useful herbs that smell especially delicious. Note that potted herbs purchased in supermarkets are likely to be harder to maintain on the long run, because they were designed for fast growth and immediate consumption. So, if you’d like to keep herbs alive in the kitchen, head to your local nursery or market and inquire about good quality organic herbs grown in nutrient-rich soil, you will get much better results.",
